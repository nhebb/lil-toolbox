<h3>Create Grid from Class</h3>
<p>Input a C# POCO, and generate a baseline XAML grid. The default control type is TextBox.
   DateTimes will generate a DatePicker, and bools will generate a CheckBox, but for other 
   data types you will need to manually change the control type.</p>

<button (click)="create()">create Grid</button>
